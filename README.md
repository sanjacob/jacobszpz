I am Jacob, a recent BSc (Hons) Software Engineering graduate from UCLan with a passion for creating quality software
and contributing to open source projects. I created [BlackboardSync][bbsync] to automatically download the files
I have on Blackboard to my devices. I also maintain [CURPSuite][curpsuite], a library to parse and validate [CURP][curp]
numbers, which has over 20k downloads on PyPI. I am also part of @MagicWeAre, the freelance mobile development team behind
[Hospitality Calculators][hcapp], released for both Android and iOS, with an install base of thousands of users.

Feel welcome to take a look at my work by browsing my repositories.
